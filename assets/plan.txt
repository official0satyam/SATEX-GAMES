SatX Games – Social Hub Development Master Plan

PROJECT NAME: SatX Games

OBJECTIVE: Upgrade the Social Hub (Profile, Feed, Chat) to a modern,
engaging, mobile-first social system similar to Instagram / Facebook /
Discord. The backend already uses Firebase and must NOT be rebuilt. We
are refining and upgrading, not starting from scratch.
